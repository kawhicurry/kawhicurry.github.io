# log a rsync mistake

I want to sync some files from 2 directories `mirror1` and`mirror2`.So I run:

```bash
nohup rsync <src>/mirror1 ./tmp -a --delete &
nohup rsync <src>/mirror2 ./tmp -a --delete &
```

the argument `--delete` would delete all the file not exist in source directories. So only second command make effect.

Avoid abusing of `--delete` when using `rsync`.
